## 1. Implementation of the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Operator (IST)
We have implemented the IST operator and studied its effects by varying the parameters $\tau$, $\lambda$, and the number of sensors $q$

## 2. Secure estimation under sparse sensor attacks
We simulated attacks on the sensors, assuming that the attacker first doesn't know the sensor's positions (unaware attack) and then knows them (aware attack)

## 3. Target Localization with Real Data
We deployed sensors in an area in order to estimate the localization of multiple targets, and studied its effectiveness with unaware and then aware attacks

## 4. Sparse Observer
We dealt with a distribuited dynamic distribuited problem and solved it through the employment of an observer

## 5. Distribuited Estimation
We studied different topologies to achieve the fastest consesus

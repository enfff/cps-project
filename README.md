# Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems

This two part project is about the modeling and control of a Cyber Physical System, a set of devices that are able to compute, to interact with one another and with the environment through sensors and actuators.

The project was developed as part of the [homonymous university class](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01UDSOV&p_a_acc=2023&p_header=S&p_lang=&multi=N) by [Simone Carena](https://github.com/SimoneCarena), [Francesco Paolo Carmone](https://github.com/enfff), [Ludovica Mazzucco](https://github.com/lumazzucco), [Federico Poulinas](https://github.com/FPKohitsuji)
